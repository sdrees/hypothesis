# These tests use the pytest plugin enabling infrastructure to restart the side-effect warnings,
# rather than trying to induce side-effects during import (and entrypoint loading) itself, which is
# hard to do.  Manual verification of behaviour during initial import can be done by just injecting
# one of the side-effect-inducing statements below directly into hypothesis.entry_points.run().
# Manual validation can also be done by inspecting the relevant state during import and verify that
# it is the same as tested here
