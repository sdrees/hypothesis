title: Announcing Hypothesis Legacy Support

For a brief period, Python 2.6 was supported in [Hypothesis for Python](
 {{site.url}}/products/#hypothesis-for-python
). Because Python 2.6 has been end of lifed for some time, I decided this wasn't
a priority and support was dropped in Hypothesis 2.0.

I've now added it back, but under a more restrictive license.

If you want to use Hypothesis on Python 2.6, you can now do so by installing
the [hypothesislegacysupport]({{site.url}}/products/#hypothesis-legacy-support)
package. This will allow you to run Hypothesis on Python 2.6.

software you will likely want to buy a commercial license. Email us at  [licensing@hypothesis.works](mailto:licensing@hypothesis.works)
to discuss details.
